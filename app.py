#  Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! üèóÔ∏è
#     - Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
#     - Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
#     - Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
#     - Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.
